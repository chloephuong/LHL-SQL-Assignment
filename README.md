# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
In this SQL project, my goals are to improve my SQL knowledge and  experience within the language through practicing. Including:
  - Get familiar with data cleaning and its process. Using SQL to clean and preprocess the data in the provided database to improve data quality and ensure that it       is suitable for analysis.
  - Apply data into business intelligence by using SQL to generate reports and insights that can be useful to inform business decisions and strategies.
  - Have better understanding about data engineering process includes develop and maintain data pipelines that collect, process, and store data from various sources.
  - Practicing data visualization by using SQL to create charts, graphs, and other visualizations to help communicate insights from the data.
  - Learn new concept of data modeling which helps create database schemas and models that can be used to organize and store data effectively.
  - Experimenting with data exploration by using SQL to explore and analyze a database to better understand the data and identify patterns and relationships.

## Process
### Step 1
I took time to carefully read through the assignment and its requirements. I also previewed all of the provided materials and the Evaluation Rubric to make sure my approach to this assignment is on the right path and meets the expectation.
### Step 2
Started my assignment with the installation process and setting up 
  - Clone repo to my local device
  - Download files
  - Run test query and commit/push test file to Github through Github Deskstop
  - Create all of the required tables with their columns and assigning data types
 ### Step 3
1. I started with Part 2 - Data Cleaning. I managed to clean some of the data such as change data type, remove some columns that offer no value, manipulate some input values.
2. Next I moved on to Part 3 - Start with Questions. I discussed with some of my peers and also follow the group chat along with the request-assistant chat box in Discord to help me have a better understanding for those questions, get tips from my peers and from there choosing the right approach to solve the questions.
3. I tried to come up with simple but efficent questions and solutions for Part 4 - Start with Data. I found myself enjoying doing this task the most compared to the rest of the tasks in this SQL assignment.
4. The Part 5 - QA Your Data took me a long time to get through since I tried to create alternative queries or run test by pulling out result based on expected value for every single query that I create in this assignment.
5. Final step was to create the ERD and have the tables linked properly. Then creating and preparing for the presentation.
