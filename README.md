## Project/Goals
In this SQL project, my goals are to improve my SQL knowledge and  experience within the language through practicing. Including:
  - Get familiar with data cleaning and its process. Using SQL to clean and preprocess the data in the provided database to improve data quality and ensure that it       is suitable for analysis.
  - Apply data into business intelligence by using SQL to generate reports and insights that can be useful to inform business decisions and strategies.
  - Have better understanding about data engineering process includes develop and maintain data pipelines that collect, process, and store data from various sources.
  - Practicing data visualization by using SQL to create charts, graphs, and other visualizations to help communicate insights from the data.
  - Learn new concept of data modeling which helps create database schemas and models that can be used to organize and store data effectively.
  - Experimenting with data exploration by using SQL to explore and analyze a database to better understand the data and identify patterns and relationships.
